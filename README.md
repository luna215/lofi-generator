# lofi-generator
Machine Learning model that can produce lofi beats. Originally started [here](https://github.com/luna215/mcahine-learning-projects/tree/main/lofi-generator), but thought it deserved its own repo

# Running the program
This uses poetry so if you have installed, then you can simply do `poetry install` to install all the dependencies for the project

### Train Network
Then you'll need to train the network
```
poetry run train_network
```

### Produce Music
```
poetry run generate_music
```
